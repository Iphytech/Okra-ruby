# Okra Ruby SDK

This is a Ruby gem for easy integration of [Okra](okra.ng) products. 

# Documentation

See [Here](https://docs.okra.ng/docs/get-started-with-okra) for the API Docs.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'okra-ruby'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install okra-ruby

## Usage

## Instantiate Okra Object

To use the SDK in your project, you need to instantiate the Okra::ruby with your API keys( public and secret). We recommed that you store API keys in your environment variable named OKRA_PUBLIC_KEY, OKRA_SECRET_KEY.  Instantiating your Okra object after adding your API keys in your environment is illustrated as follows below:

```ruby

OkraTest = OkraSDK.new

```

This throws a `OKRABadKeyError` if no key is found in the environment variable.

### Instantiate Okra object in Sandbox without environment variable:

You can instantiate your Okra object by passing your public , secret key as an argument of the `OkraSDk` class just as displayed below:

```ruby

OkraTest = OkraSDK.new("public_key", "secret_key)

```

#### `NOTE:` It is best practice to always set your API keys to your environment variable for security purpose. Please be warned not use this package without setting your API keys in your environment variables in production.

#### To instantiate Okra object in production with environment variable:

Simply use it as displayed below:

```ruby

OkraTest = OkraSDK.new("YOUR_OKRA_LIVE_PUBLIC_KEY", "YOUR_OKRA_LIVE_SECRET_KEY", true)

```
